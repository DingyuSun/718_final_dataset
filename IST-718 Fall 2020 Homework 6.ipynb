Short code snippets are allowed from the internet.  Code from the class text books or class provided code can be copied in its entirety.__\n","- Do not modify cells marked as grading cells or marked as do not modify.\n","- Before submitting your work, remember to check for run time errors with the following procedure:\n","`Runtime `$\\rightarrow$ Factory reset runtime followed by Runtime $\\rightarrow$ Run All.  All runtime errors will result in a minimum penalty of half off.\n","- Google Colab is the official class runtime environment so you should test your code on Colab before submission.\n","- All plots shall include descriptive title and axis labels.  Plot legends shall be included where possible.  Unless stated otherwise, plots can be made using any Python plotting package.  It is understood that spark data structures must be converted to something like numpy or pandas prior to making plots.  All required mathematical operations, filtering, selection, etc., required by a homework question shall be performed in spark prior to converting to numpy or pandas.\n","- Grading feedback cells are there for graders to provide feedback to students.  Don't change or remove grading feedback cells.\n","- Don't add or remove files from your git repo.\n","- Do not change file names in your repo.  This also means don't change the title of the ipython notebook.\n","- You are free to add additional code cells around the cells marked `your code here`.\n","- We reserve the right to take points off for operations that are extremely inefficient or \"heavy weight\".  This is a big data class and extremely inefficient operations make a big difference when scaling up to large data sets.  For example, the spark dataframe collect() method is a very heavy weight operation and should not be used unless it there is a real need for it.  An example where collect() might be needed is to get ready to make a plot after filtering a spark dataframe.\n","- import * is not allowed because it is considered a very bad coding practice and in some cases can result in a significant delay (which slows down the grading process) in loading imports.  For example, the statement `from sympy import *` is not allowed.  You must import the specific packages that you need. \n","- The graders reserve the right to deduct points for subjective things we see with your code.  For example, if we ask you to create a pandas data frame to display values from an investigation and you hard code the values, we will take points off for that.  This is only one of many different things we could find in reviewing your code.  In general, write your code like you are submitting it for a code peer review in industry.  \n","- Level of effort is part of our subjective grading.  For example, in cases where we ask for a more open ended investigation, some students put in significant effort and some students do the minimum possible to meet requirements.  In these cases, we may take points off for students who did not put in much effort as compared to students who put in a lot of effort.  We feel that the students who did a better job deserve a better grade.  We reserve the right to invoke level of effort grading at any time.\n","- Only use spark, spark machine learning, spark data frames, RDD's, and map reduce to solve all problems unless instructed otherwise.\n","- Your notebook must run from start to finish without requiring manual input by the graders.  For example, do not mount your personal Google drive in your notebook as this will require graders to perform manual steps.  In short, your notebook should run from start to finish with no runtime errors and no need for graders to perform any manual steps.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"KEjZ4Xye6uLh"},"source":["## Note that this notebook is expected to run in the Google Colab environment.
